**Some of the gift interaction colliders are a bit finicky, be persistent, they're there! <3**

Takes a minute to load the first time, please be patient!! We filled this game with so much love! If you can't make a selection with the mouse cursor, Q or E chooses the left or right option respectively!


In a town on a lil' island,  the people  live simply, satisfied with village gossip. Until, one day, Godzilla appears! He hasn’t… done anything yet, but he could! He’s certainly been walking around the island menacingly!


In this campy, theatrical, romantic comedy, play as the Hero, recruited to defeat Godzilla! Take his shopping list, get him gifts, make friends, and set up the townsfolk! Maybe even you will fall in love!!


Features:

    Sick walking action
    Speedrunning, for those who are impatient
    A day/night cycle
    Love
    A handheld companion to love and cherish
    A bench(?)
    The real treasure, the friends you made along the way
    Godzilla!!
